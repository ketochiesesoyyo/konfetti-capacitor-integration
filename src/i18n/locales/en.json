        "question": "How do I join an event?",
        "answer": "You can join an event using either the invite link shared by the host, or by entering the event code manually in the Join Event page."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is my profile public?",
        "answer": "No, your profile is only visible to other attendees of events you've joined. Once an event ends (3 days after the event date), your profile becomes invisible to those attendees."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What happens after the event ends?",
        "answer": "Matchmaking closes 3 days after the event date. After that, you can no longer swipe or match with new people from that event, but existing matches and chats remain accessible."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Can I join multiple events?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can join as many events as you're invited to. Your profile will be visible separately in each event."

      "q5": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",

      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How does matchmaking timing work?",
        "answer": "Matchmaking opens 1 week before the event date and closes 3 days after. This gives guests time to connect before and after the celebration."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Can I edit my profile after joining?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can edit your profile, photos, bio, interests, and prompts at any time from the Profile page."
